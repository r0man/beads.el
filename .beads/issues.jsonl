The package should live in the lisp/ directory and provide an intuitive, keyboard-driven UI for working with Beads issues directly from Emacs.\n\nKey features:\n- Status buffer showing issues by status (open, in_progress, blocked, closed)\n- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations (create, update, close, show details)\n- Integration with existing beads CLI via subprocess calls\n- Transient menus for complex operations (similar to Magit's interface)\n- Jump to issue definitions in code\n- Inline editing of issue fields\n- Dependency visualization\n- Integration with Emacs project.el for multi-project support\n\nThis will make Beads more accessible to Emacs users and provide a seamless workflow for AI-supervised coding within the editor.","design":"## Architecture\n\n### Transient Menu System\n- Root transient menu accessible via M-x beads\n- Hierarchical menu structure following Magit patterns\n- All bd CLI commands exposed with full flag/argument support\n- Uses Emacs transient library for interactive menus\n\n### List Display Mode\nCommands that display lists of items should use Emacs tabulated-list-mode:\n- **bd list** - List of issues in tabulated format\n- **bd ready** - Ready work shown in tabulated format\n- **bd blocked** - Blocked issues in tabulated format\n- **bd stats** - Statistics displayed in tabulated format (where applicable)\n- **bd dep list** - Dependencies shown in tabulated format\n\nInterface similar to M-x proced:\n- Sortable columns (click headers to sort)\n- Keyboard navigation (n/p for next/prev)\n- Actions on current item (RET to show details, u to update, c to close, etc.)\n- Refresh capability (g to refresh)\n- Mark/unmark items for batch operations\n- Filter/narrow functionality\n\n### Buffer Organization\n- *beads-status* - Main status buffer (like magit-status)\n- *beads-list* - Issue list buffer (tabulated-list-mode)\n- *beads-ready* - Ready work buffer (tabulated-list-mode)\n- *beads-blocked* - Blocked issues buffer (tabulated-list-mode)\n- *beads-show: \u003cid\u003e* - Issue detail buffers\n- *beads-output* - Command output/results buffer\n\n### Integration Points\n- Uses bd CLI via process calls (call-process, start-process)\n- JSON output parsing for structured data\n- project.el integration for multi-project support\n- Auto-refresh after mutations (create, update, close, etc.)","acceptance_criteria":"### Core Transient Menu System\n- [ ] Main entry point: M-x beads (or custom keybinding) opens root transient menu\n- [ ] Root menu shows all available bd commands organized hierarchically\n- [ ] Navigation through menu hierarchy matches Magit UX patterns\n- [ ] All transient menus use the Emacs transient library\n\n### Command Coverage (100% of bd CLI)\nEvery bd command must be accessible via transient menus with full option support:\n\n- [ ] **init** - Initialize bd in directory\n  - Flags: --prefix, --db path\n  \n- [ ] **create** - Create new issue\n  - Arguments: title (required)\n  - Flags: -t/--type, -p/--priority, -d/--description, --id, --deps, --json\n  \n- [ ] **list** -

Flags: -i/--input, --dry-run, --resolve-collisions, --json\n\n### Global Flags Support\n- [ ] All commands support global flags: --actor, --db, --json, --no-auto-flush, --no-auto-import\n- [ ] Transient menu allows setting global flags before command execution\n- [ ] Settings persist within Emacs session\n\n### User Experience\n- [ ] Transient menus show current flag/option values\n- [ ] Help text displays for each option (like Magit's inline help)\n- [ ] Validation for required arguments before command execution\n- [ ] Command output displayed in dedicated buffer\n- [ ] Error messages clearly shown\n- [ ] Success feedback with option to refresh status buffer\n\n### Testing\n- [ ] Manual testing of all commands via transient menus\n- [ ] Verification that all flags/options work correctly\n- [ ] Edge cases (missing required args, invalid values) handled gracefully","notes":"**Core Goal Update (2025-10-18)**: The primary objective of beads.el is to provide complete 1-to-1 coverage of the Beads CLI. For every 'bd' command and flag, there should be a corresponding Emacs command accessible through the beads.el interface. Users should be able to perform all bd operations without leaving Emacs.\n\nThis means:\n- Every bd subcommand (init, create, list, show, update, close, ready, blocked, stats, dep, export, import) must have an Emacs equivalent\n- All flags and options for each command must be supported in the transient menus\n- The Emacs interface should provide the same level of control as the CLI, just with better UX for Emacs users\n\n**New BD CLI Commands Requiring Emacs Implementation (Updated 2025-10-18)**:\nThe following bd commands exist in the CLI but do not have Emacs implementations yet:\n\n1. **compact** - Compact old closed issues using semantic summarization (tier 1: 30 days, tier 2: 90 days)\n2. **daemon** - Run background sync daemon with auto-commit/push capabilities (may be automatic in Emacs context)\n3. **delete** - Delete an issue and clean up all references (destructive operation)\n4. **epic** - Epic management commands (NEW: subcommands for working with epics)\n5. **label** - Manage issue labels (subcommands: add, list, list-all, remove)\n6. **rename-prefix** - Rename the issue prefix for all issues in the database\n7. **renumber** - Renumber all issues sequentially to eliminate ID gaps\n8. **reopen** - Reopen closed issues (more explicit than update --status open)\n9. **restore** - Restore full history of a compacted issue from git\n10. **sync** - Synchronize issues with git remote in single operation\n\n**Already Implemented Commands**:\nThe following bd commands already have Emacs implementations:\n- blocked, close, create, dep (add/remove/tree/cycles), export, import, init, list, quickstart, ready, show, stats, update\n\n**Commands Not Requiring Emacs Implementation**:\n- completion (Emacs has its own completion system)\n- help (covered by Emacs help system)\n- version (not essential; could be shown in beads main menu if needed)\n\n**Note on Global Flags**:\nThe bd CLI now has a --no-daemon flag that should be supported in all transient menus alongside existing global flags (--actor, --db, --json, --no-auto-flush, --no-auto-import).","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-10-22T19:05:39.013901995+02:00","updated_at":"2025-10-22T19:05:39.013901995+02:00","source_repo":"."}

\"press Enter to do it\"\n- Standard in many Emacs interfaces (completing-read, etc.)\n- One less keystroke (no Shift needed)\n- Muscle memory from other applications\n\nIf RET works, consider using it as primary execute key with `x` as alternative.\n\n## Main Menu vs Bulk Operations Consistency\n\nKEY INSIGHT: Bindings should be consistent between:\n1. Main transient menu (M-x beads)\n2. Buffer-level single operations (e.g., `c` in list mode)\n3. Bulk operations (e.g., `B c` in list mode)\n\nExample inconsistency to fix:\n- If main menu uses `c` for create\n- And list mode uses `c` for create\n- And bulk prefix is `B`\n- Then bulk operations should mirror: `B c`, `B e`, `B d`, etc.\n\nCurrent state to check:\n- Main menu: What keys are used?\n- List mode single: `c` create, `e` update, `d`/`k` close, `o` reopen, `D` delete\n- List mode bulk: `B s` (status), `B p` (priority), `B c` (close), `B o` (reopen)\n\nNotice: Bulk uses different keys than single operations!\n- Single: `e` for update\n- Bulk: `B s` for status, `B p` for priority (no `B e` for update?)\n\nProposal: Make bulk operations use same keys as single operations\n- `B c` - bulk close (matches `d`/`k` single close)\n- `B o` - bulk reopen (matches `o` single reopen)  \n- `B e` - bulk update (matches `e` single update)\n- `B d` - bulk delete? (matches `D` single delete)\n\nThis makes it easier to remember: \"press B before the normal key to do bulk operation\"","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-22T19:05:39.013901995+02:00","updated_at":"2025-10-22T19:05:39.013901995+02:00","source_repo":"."}
