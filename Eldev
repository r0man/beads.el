;; =============================================================================
;; CRITICAL: Force newer transient from GNU ELPA over the built-in version
;; =============================================================================
;;
;; Emacs 29+ and 30+ have a BUILT-IN transient at an older version (~0.3.x)
;; that doesn't have `transient-define-group` (added in v0.9.0).
;;
;; The problem:
;; 1. When `(require 'transient)` runs, it finds the built-in version first
;; 2. The built-in provides the 'transient feature
;; 3. Once a feature is provided, require doesn't reload it
;; 4. Our code uses transient-define-group which doesn't exist in the built-in
;;
;; The solution:
;; Use `package-install-upgrade-built-in` to tell Emacs to prefer newer
;; installed packages over built-in ones. This variable must be set BEFORE
;; any package operations occur. Eldev manages package installation, so we
;; just set this variable and let Eldev handle the rest.
;; =============================================================================

;; Ensure package-install-upgrade-built-in is set before any package operations
;; This tells Emacs to prefer installed packages over built-in ones
;; Note: This variable was added in Emacs 29.1, so we check if it exists first
(when (boundp 'package-install-upgrade-built-in)
  (setq package-install-upgrade-built-in t))

;; Enable undercover.el for code coverage tracking
(eldev-use-plugin 'undercover)

;; Configure undercover to track coverage for all lisp/*.el files except tests
;; This excludes lisp/test/* files from coverage instrumentation
(setf eldev-undercover-fileset '("lisp/*.el" ":not" "lisp/test/*.el"))

;; Use codecov format and don't auto-send
(setf eldev-undercover-config '(codecov dontsend))

;; IMPORTANT: Fix transient edebug specs BEFORE undercover instruments files.
;;
;; Undercover uses edebug to instrument code for coverage. Edebug needs
;; proper specs for macros like `transient-define-prefix` to parse them.
;;
;; PROBLEM: Transient's edebug spec for transient-define-prefix uses
;; `[&rest vectorp]` which only allows vectors. But transient supports
;; including pre-defined groups by symbol reference (via transient-define-group).
;; This causes "Failed matching" errors when edebug tries to parse prefixes
;; that use symbol references like `beads-option-global-section`.
;;
;; SOLUTION: Override the edebug specs to accept both vectors and symbols
;; using `[&rest [&or symbolp vectorp]]`. This must happen:
;; 1. After transient is loaded (so we can override its specs)
;; 2. Before undercover sets up its file handlers
;;
;; By adding this hook without APPEND, it runs before undercover's hook.
