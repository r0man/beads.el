For every 'bd' command and flag, there should be a corresponding Emacs command accessible through the beads.el interface. Users should be able to perform all bd operations without leaving Emacs.\n\nThis means:\n- Every bd subcommand (init, create, list, show, update, close, ready, blocked, stats, dep, export, import) must have an Emacs equivalent\n- All flags and options for each command must be supported in the transient menus\n- The Emacs interface should provide the same level of control as the CLI, just with better UX for Emacs users\n\n**New BD CLI Commands Requiring Emacs Implementation (Updated 2025-10-18)**:\nThe following bd commands exist in the CLI but do not have Emacs implementations yet:\n\n1. **compact** - Compact old closed issues using semantic summarization (tier 1: 30 days, tier 2: 90 days)\n2. **daemon** - Run background sync daemon with auto-commit/push capabilities (may be automatic in Emacs context)\n3. **delete** - Delete an issue and clean up all references (destructive operation)\n4. **epic** - Epic management commands (NEW: subcommands for working with epics)\n5. **label** - Manage issue labels (subcommands: add, list, list-all, remove)\n6. **rename-prefix** - Rename the issue prefix for all issues in the database\n7. **renumber** - Renumber all issues sequentially to eliminate ID gaps\n8. **reopen** - Reopen closed issues (more explicit than update --status open)\n9. **restore** - Restore full history of a compacted issue from git\n10. **sync** - Synchronize issues with git remote in single operation\n\n**Already Implemented Commands**:\nThe following bd commands already have Emacs implementations:\n- blocked, close, create, dep (add/remove/tree/cycles), export, import, init, list, quickstart, ready, show, stats, update\n\n**Commands Not Requiring Emacs Implementation**:\n- completion (Emacs has its own completion system)\n- help (covered by Emacs help system)\n- version (not essential; could be shown in beads main menu if needed)\n\n**Note on Global Flags**:\nThe bd CLI now has a --no-daemon flag that should be supported in all transient menus alongside existing global flags (--actor, --db, --json, --no-auto-flush, --no-auto-import).","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-10-22T19:05:39.013901995+02:00","updated_at":"2025-10-22T19:05:39.013901995+02:00","source_repo":"."}
