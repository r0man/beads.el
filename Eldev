;; IMPORTANT: Fix transient edebug specs BEFORE undercover instruments files.
;;
;; Undercover uses edebug to instrument code for coverage. Edebug needs
;; proper specs for macros like `transient-define-prefix` to parse them.
;;
;; PROBLEM: Transient's edebug spec for transient-define-prefix uses
;; `[&rest vectorp]` which only allows vectors. But transient supports
;; including pre-defined groups by symbol reference (via transient-define-group).
;; This causes "Failed matching" errors when edebug tries to parse prefixes
;; that use symbol references like `beads-option-global-section`.
;;
;; SOLUTION: Override the edebug specs to accept both vectors and symbols
;; using `[&rest [&or symbolp vectorp]]`. This must happen:
;; 1. After transient is loaded (so we can override its specs)
;; 2. Before undercover sets up its file handlers
;;
;; By adding this hook without APPEND, it runs before undercover's hook.
