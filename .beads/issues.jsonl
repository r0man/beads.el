{"id":"beads.el-1","title":"beads.el: Magit-like Emacs interface for Beads","description":"Build an Emacs Lisp package that provides a Magit-like porcelain interface for Beads issue tracking. The package should live in the lisp/ directory and provide an intuitive, keyboard-driven UI for working with Beads issues directly from Emacs.\n\nKey features:\n- Status buffer showing issues by status (open, in_progress, blocked, closed)\n- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations (create, update, close, show details)\n- Integration with existing beads CLI via subprocess calls\n- Transient menus for complex operations (similar to Magit's interface)\n- Jump to issue definitions in code\n- Inline editing of issue fields\n- Dependency visualization\n- Integration with Emacs project.el for multi-project support\n\nThis will make Beads more accessible to Emacs users and provide a seamless workflow for AI-supervised coding within the editor.","design":"## Architecture\n\n### Transient Menu System\n- Root transient menu accessible via M-x beads\n- Hierarchical menu structure following Magit patterns\n- All bd CLI commands exposed with full flag/argument support\n- Uses Emacs transient library for interactive menus\n\n### List Display Mode\nCommands that display lists of items should use Emacs tabulated-list-mode:\n- **bd list** - List of issues in tabulated format\n- **bd ready** - Ready work shown in tabulated format\n- **bd blocked** - Blocked issues in tabulated format\n- **bd stats** - Statistics displayed in tabulated format (where applicable)\n- **bd dep list** - Dependencies shown in tabulated format\n\nInterface similar to M-x proced:\n- Sortable columns (click headers to sort)\n- Keyboard navigation (n/p for next/prev)\n- Actions on current item (RET to show details, u to update, c to close, etc.)\n- Refresh capability (g to refresh)\n- Mark/unmark items for batch operations\n- Filter/narrow functionality\n\n### Buffer Organization\n- *beads-status* - Main status buffer (like magit-status)\n- *beads-list* - Issue list buffer (tabulated-list-mode)\n- *beads-ready* - Ready work buffer (tabulated-list-mode)\n- *beads-blocked* - Blocked issues buffer (tabulated-list-mode)\n- *beads-show: \u003cid\u003e* - Issue detail buffers\n- *beads-output* - Command output/results buffer\n\n### Integration Points\n- Uses bd CLI via process calls (call-process, start-process)\n- JSON output parsing for structured data\n- project.el integration for multi-project support\n- Auto-refresh after mutations (create, update, close, etc.)","acceptance_criteria":"### Core Transient Menu System\n- [ ] Main entry point: M-x beads (or custom keybinding) opens root transient menu\n- [ ] Root menu shows all available bd commands organized hierarchically\n- [ ] Navigation through menu hierarchy matches Magit UX patterns\n- [ ] All transient menus use the Emacs transient library\n\n### Command Coverage (100% of bd CLI)\nEvery bd command must be accessible via transient menus with full option support:\n\n- [ ] **init** - Initialize bd in directory\n  - Flags: --prefix, --db path\n  \n- [ ] **create** - Create new issue\n  - Arguments: title (required)\n  - Flags: -t/--type, -p/--priority, -d/--description, --id, --deps, --json\n  \n- [ ] **list** -

[ ] dep list - List dependencies\n    - Arguments: issue-id (required)\n    - Flags: --json\n    \n- [ ] **export** - Export to JSONL\n  - Flags: -o/--output, --json\n  \n- [ ] **import** - Import from JSONL\n  - Flags: -i/--input, --dry-run, --resolve-collisions, --json\n\n### Global Flags Support\n- [ ] All commands support global flags: --actor, --db, --json, --no-auto-flush, --no-auto-import\n- [ ] Transient menu allows setting global flags before command execution\n- [ ] Settings persist within Emacs session\n\n### User Experience\n- [ ] Transient menus show current flag/option values\n- [ ] Help text displays for each option (like Magit's inline help)\n- [ ] Validation for required arguments before command execution\n- [ ] Command output displayed in dedicated buffer\n- [ ] Error messages clearly shown\n- [ ] Success feedback with option to refresh status buffer\n\n### Testing\n- [ ] Manual testing of all commands via transient menus\n- [ ] Verification that all flags/options work correctly\n- [ ] Edge cases (missing required args, invalid values) handled gracefully","notes":"**Core Goal Update (2025-10-18)**: The primary objective of beads.el is to provide complete 1-to-1 coverage of the Beads CLI. For every 'bd' command and flag, there should be a corresponding Emacs command accessible through the beads.el interface. Users should be able to perform all bd operations without leaving Emacs.\n\nThis means:\n- Every bd subcommand (init, create, list, show, update, close, ready, blocked, stats, dep, export, import) must have an Emacs equivalent\n- All flags and options for each command must be supported in the transient menus\n- The Emacs interface should provide the same level of control as the CLI, just with better UX for Emacs users","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-10-18T16:10:38.80885934+02:00","updated_at":"2025-10-18T14:13:27.678702191Z"}
