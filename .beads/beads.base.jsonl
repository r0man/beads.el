While this tests real behavior, it:\n- Is slower than unit tests\n- Requires bd CLI to be available\n- Doesn't test individual components in isolation\n- Makes it harder to test edge cases and error conditions\n\n## What to Add\n\nAdd unit tests for command class internals that don't require bd execution:\n\n### 1. Command Construction Tests\nTest that command classes build correct argument lists:\n```elisp\n(ert-deftest beads-command-test-list-command-line ()\n  \"Test beads-command-list builds correct arguments.\"\n  (let ((cmd (beads-command-list \n              :status \"open\" \n              :priority 1\n              :no-daemon t)))\n    (should (member \"--status\" (beads-command-line cmd)))\n    (should (member \"open\" (beads-command-line cmd)))\n    (should (member \"--priority\" (beads-command-line cmd)))\n    (should (member \"--no-daemon\" (beads-command-line cmd)))))\n```\n\n### 2. Validation Tests\nTest validation logic without executing commands:\n- Priority range validation (0-4)\n- Type validation (bug, feature, task, etc.)\n- Required field validation (title, issue-id, etc.)\n- Dependency format validation\n- Option conflict detection\n\n### 3. Argument Building Edge Cases\n- Empty/nil values\n- Special characters in strings\n- Unicode handling\n- Very long strings\n- Multiple values (labels, dependencies)\n\n### 4. Class Instantiation\n- Default values\n- Slot type checking\n- Inheritance chain\n\n## Benefits\n\n- Faster test execution\n- Better test isolation\n- Easier to test edge cases\n- Can run without bd CLI installed\n- Complements integration tests\n\n## Implementation\n\n- Keep existing integration tests (they verify actual bd behavior)\n- Add new unit test files or sections in existing test files\n- Aim for \u003e80% code coverage on command class methods\n- Focus on beads-command-line, beads-command-validate, argument building\n\n## Related\n\nThis addresses feedback from PR #19 code review comment about test coverage concerns.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-14T09:07:24.169838411Z","updated_at":"2025-11-14T09:12:23.238253983Z","closed_at":"2025-11-14T09:12:23.238253983Z"}

{"id":"beads.el-1","title":"beads.el: Magit-like Emacs interface for Beads","description":"Build an Emacs Lisp package that provides a Magit-like porcelain interface for Beads issue tracking. The package should live in the lisp/ directory and provide an intuitive, keyboard-driven UI for working with Beads issues directly from Emacs.\n\nKey features:\n- Status buffer showing issues by status (open, in_progress, blocked, closed)\n- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations (create, update, close, show details)\n- Integration with existing beads CLI via subprocess calls\n- Transient menus for complex operations (similar to Magit's interface)\n- Jump to issue definitions in code\n- Inline editing of issue fields\n- Dependency visualization\n- Integration with Emacs project.el for multi-project support\n\nThis will make Beads more accessible to Emacs users and provide a seamless workflow for AI-supervised coding within the editor.","notes":"**Core Goal Update (2025-10-18)**: The primary objective of beads.el is to provide complete 1-to-1 coverage of the Beads CLI. For every 'bd' command and flag, there should be a corresponding Emacs command accessible through the beads.el interface. Users should be able to perform all bd operations without leaving Emacs.\n\nThis means:\n- Every bd subcommand (init, create, list, show, update, close, ready, blocked, stats, dep, export, import) must have an Emacs equivalent\n- All flags and options for each command must be supported in the transient menus\n- The Emacs interface should provide the same level of control as the CLI, just with better UX for Emacs users\n\n**New BD CLI Commands Requiring Emacs Implementation (Updated 2025-10-18)**:\nThe following bd commands exist in the CLI but do not have Emacs implementations yet:\n\n1. **compact** - Compact old closed issues using semantic summarization (tier 1: 30 days, tier 2: 90 days)\n2. **daemon** - Run background sync daemon with auto-commit/push capabilities (may be automatic in Emacs context)\n3. **delete** - Delete an issue and clean up all references (destructive operation)\n4. **epic** - Epic management commands (NEW: subcommands for working with epics)\n5. **label** - Manage issue labels (subcommands: add, list, list-all, remove)\n6. **rename-prefix** - Rename the issue prefix for all issues in the database\n7. **renumber** - Renumber all issues sequentially to eliminate ID gaps\n8. **reopen** - Reopen closed issues (more explicit than update --status open)\n9. **restore** - Restore full history of a compacted issue from git\n10. **sync** - Synchronize issues with git remote in single operation\n\n**Already Implemented Commands**:\nThe following bd commands already have Emacs implementations:\n- blocked, close, create, dep (add/remove/tree/cycles), export, import, init, list, quickstart, ready, show, stats, update\n\n**Commands Not Requiring Emacs Implementation**:\n- completion (Emacs has its own completion system)\n- help (covered by Emacs help system)\n- version (not essential; could be shown in beads main menu if needed)\n\n**Note on Global Flags**:\nThe bd CLI now has a --no-daemon flag that should be supported in all transient menus alongside existing global flags (--actor, --db, --json, --no-auto-flush, --no-auto-import).","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-10-22T19:05:39.013901995+02:00","updated_at":"2025-10-22T19:05:39.013901995+02:00"}
