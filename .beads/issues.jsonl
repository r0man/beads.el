{"id":"beads.el-1","title":"beads.el: Magit-like Emacs interface for Beads","description":"Build an Emacs Lisp package that provides a Magit-like porcelain interface for Beads issue tracking. The package should live in the lisp/ directory and provide an intuitive, keyboard-driven UI for working with Beads issues directly from Emacs.\n\nKey features:\n- Status buffer showing issues by status (open, in_progress, blocked, closed)\n- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations (create, update, close, show details)\n- Integration with existing beads CLI via subprocess calls\n- Transient menus for complex operations (similar to Magit's interface)\n- Jump to issue definitions in code\n- Inline editing of issue fields\n- Dependency visualization\n- Integration with Emacs project.el for multi-project support\n\nThis will make Beads more accessible to Emacs users and provide a seamless workflow for AI-supervised coding within the editor.","design":"## Architecture\n\n### Transient Menu System\n- Root transient menu accessible via M-x beads\n- Hierarchical menu structure following Magit patterns\n- All bd CLI commands exposed with full flag/argument support\n- Uses Emacs transient library for interactive menus\n\n### List Display Mode\nCommands that display lists of items should use Emacs tabulated-list-mode:\n- **bd list** - List of issues in tabulated format\n- **bd ready** - Ready work shown in tabulated format\n- **bd blocked** - Blocked issues in tabulated format\n- **bd stats** - Statistics displayed in tabulated format (where applicable)\n- **bd dep list** - Dependencies shown in tabulated format\n\nInterface similar to M-x proced:\n- Sortable columns (click headers to sort)\n- Keyboard navigation (n/p for next/prev)\n- Actions on current item (RET to show details, u to update, c to close, etc.)\n- Refresh capability (g to refresh)\n- Mark/unmark items for batch operations\n- Filter/narrow functionality\n\n### Buffer Organization\n- *beads-status* - Main status buffer (like magit-status)\n- *beads-list* - Issue list buffer (tabulated-list-mode)\n- *beads-ready* - Ready work buffer (tabulated-list-mode)\n- *beads-blocked* - Blocked issues buffer (tabulated-list-mode)\n- *beads-show: \u003cid\u003e* - Issue detail buffers\n- *beads-output* - Command output/results buffer\n\n### Integration Points\n- Uses bd CLI via process calls (call-process, start-process)\n- JSON output parsing for structured data\n- project.el integration for multi-project support\n- Auto-refresh after mutations (create, update, close, etc.)","acceptance_criteria":"### Core Transient Menu System\n- [ ] Main entry point: M-x beads (or custom keybinding) opens root transient menu\n- [ ] Root menu shows all available bd commands organized hierarchically\n- [ ] Navigation through menu hierarchy matches Magit UX patterns\n- [ ] All transient menus use the Emacs transient library\n\n### Command Coverage (100% of bd CLI)\nEvery bd command must be accessible via transient menus with full option support:\n\n- [ ] **init** -

For every 'bd' command and flag, there should be a corresponding Emacs command accessible through the beads.el interface. Users should be able to perform all bd operations without leaving Emacs.\n\nThis means:\n- Every bd subcommand (init, create, list, show, update, close, ready, blocked, stats, dep, export, import) must have an Emacs equivalent\n- All flags and options for each command must be supported in the transient menus\n- The Emacs interface should provide the same level of control as the CLI, just with better UX for Emacs users\n\n**New BD CLI Commands Requiring Emacs Implementation (Updated 2025-10-18)**:\nThe following bd commands exist in the CLI but do not have Emacs implementations yet:\n\n1. **compact** - Compact old closed issues using semantic summarization (tier 1: 30 days, tier 2: 90 days)\n2. **daemon** - Run background sync daemon with auto-commit/push capabilities (may be automatic in Emacs context)\n3. **delete** - Delete an issue and clean up all references (destructive operation)\n4. **epic** - Epic management commands (NEW: subcommands for working with epics)\n5. **label** - Manage issue labels (subcommands: add, list, list-all, remove)\n6. **rename-prefix** - Rename the issue prefix for all issues in the database\n7. **renumber** - Renumber all issues sequentially to eliminate ID gaps\n8. **reopen** - Reopen closed issues (more explicit than update --status open)\n9. **restore** - Restore full history of a compacted issue from git\n10. **sync** - Synchronize issues with git remote in single operation\n\n**Already Implemented Commands**:\nThe following bd commands already have Emacs implementations:\n- blocked, close, create, dep (add/remove/tree/cycles), export, import, init, list, quickstart, ready, show, stats, update\n\n**Commands Not Requiring Emacs Implementation**:\n- completion (Emacs has its own completion system)\n- help (covered by Emacs help system)\n- version (not essential; could be shown in beads main menu if needed)\n\n**Note on Global Flags**:\nThe bd CLI now has a --no-daemon flag that should be supported in all transient menus alongside existing global flags (--actor, --db, --json, --no-auto-flush, --no-auto-import).","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-10-18T16:10:38.80885934+02:00","updated_at":"2025-10-20T18:14:53.580561975+02:00"}

Show/view issue details (current)\n- `c` - Create new issue (current, matches dired `C` for copy/create)\n- `e` - Edit/update issue (current, matches dired edit)\n- `d` - Mark for deletion/closing (like dired `d` for delete)\n- `x` - Execute marked operations (like dired `x`)\n- `k` - Kill/close immediately (like `k` in many modes)\n- `o` - Reopen (current)\n- `D` - Delete permanently (current, matches dired `D`)\n\nOr alternative:\n- `c` -
