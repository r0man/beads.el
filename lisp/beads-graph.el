;;; Commentary:

;; beads-graph.el provides visual dependency graph generation using
;; Graphviz dot.  Generates interactive graphs showing issue
;; dependencies with support for filtering and navigation.
;;
;; Commands:
;;   M-x beads-graph-all      ; Show graph of all issues
;;   M-x beads-graph-issue    ; Show graph for specific issue
;;
;; Requirements:
;;   - graphviz (dot command) must be installed
;;
;; Key bindings in beads-graph-mode:
;;   RET     - Jump to issue at point
;;   g       - Refresh graph
;;   f       - Apply filters
;;   c       - Clear filters
;;   e       - Export graph to file
;;   q       - Quit

;;; Code:

(require 'beads)
