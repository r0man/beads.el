;;; Commentary:

;; This module provides the `bd delete' command interface for beads.el.
;;
;; The bd delete command permanently deletes an issue and cleans up all
;; references to it.  This is a destructive operation that:
;; 1. Removes all dependency links (any type, both directions)
;; 2. Updates text references to '[deleted:ID]' in directly connected issues
;; 3. Deletes the issue from the database
;;
;; Workflow:
;; 1. User calls `beads-delete', selects issue
;; 2. Preview is shown (bd delete without --force)
;; 3. User confirms yes/no
;; 4. If yes: execute deletion (bd delete --force)
;; 5. If no: cancel operation
;;
;; Features:
;; - Interactive preview before deletion
;; - Context-aware: works from show/list buffers
;; - Refreshes all buffers after deletion

;;; Code:

(require 'beads-show)
